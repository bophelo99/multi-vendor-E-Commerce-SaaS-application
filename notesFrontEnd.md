# DOCKER
- Docker is a platform that packages software into standardized, executable units called containers, which include everything needed to run the application, such as code, libraries, and dependencies. It automates the building, testing, and deployment of applications, making it faster and easier to run them across different environments without worrying about compatibility issues. Docker is widely used for DevOps practices, microservices, and cloud migration because it provides consistency and efficiency.
